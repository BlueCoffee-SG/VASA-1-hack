# VASA-1-hack
Using Claude Opus to reverse engineer code from white paper (this is for La Raza)


modules cherry picked from 
https://github.com/yerfor/Real3DPortrait/


all the models / code created in all.py from Claude Opus.
(I'm considering that the Real3DPortrait code has a correct implmentation of MegaPortrait foundation code.)


According to the VASA-1 paper, there are three main encoders used in the VASA framework:

**Appearance Feature Extractor (AFE):** Extracts the canonical 3D appearance volume from the input face image.
**Canonical Keypoint Detector (CKD):** Detects the canonical keypoints from the input face image.
**Head Pose Estimator and Expression Deformation Estimator (HPE_EDE):** Estimates the head pose and expression deformation parameters from the input face image.

**MotionFieldEstimator:** The motion field estimator predicts the deformation field and occlusion masks based on the appearance features, keypoints, and rotation matrices. It includes the option to predict multiple occlusion masks for different purposes.
**Generator:** The generator module takes the appearance features, deformation field, and occlusion masks as input and generates the final output image. It includes the option to return intermediate hidden features for further processing.



The **AppearanceFeatureExtractor** takes an input face image and extracts the canonical 3D appearance volume using a series of convolutional and downsampling layers followed by 3D residual blocks.

The **CanonicalKeypointDetector** takes an input face image and detects the canonical keypoints using a series of downsampling layers, followed by a 3D upsampling network and a final convolutional layer to produce a heatmap. The keypoints are obtained by taking the argmax of the heatmap.

The **HeadPoseExpressionEstimator** takes an input face image and estimates the head pose (yaw, pitch, roll) and expression deformation parameters. It uses a series of residual bottleneck blocks followed by fully connected layers to predict the head pose angles, translation vector, and deformation parameters.


These encoders form the core components of the VASA framework for extracting the necessary information from the input face image for subsequent processing and generation steps.


```python
from modules.real3d.facev2v_warp.network2 import AppearanceFeatureExtractor, CanonicalKeypointDetector, PoseExpressionEstimator, MotionFieldEstimator, Generator

```
